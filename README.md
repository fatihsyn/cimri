# WordPress cimri XML Api

You can quickly transfer the products in your WordPress site to "Cimri". Using the miser api is so easy!

Add the necessary fields to the product, then let Api do it for you.

How do we do?

Add the following fields to the Add new custom field field and add the contents in return. Then the API will automatically pull the data and add it to the API.
